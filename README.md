# Room-Thermometer
Get an Arduino (nano would suffice), 6 LEDs, and a temp sensor (BMP085). 

Powering the device is up to you. An option would be using 5v 1A cellphone charger or using a 3.7 lipo batt and a booster.

Cardboard is enough for the casing. Do as you please. 

Arrange LEDs in such a way that they represent levels of temp, label accordingly. Make sure to follow correct pin connections.

Remarks:
  Would probably update this (change sensor) // DHT11 sensor is better since it is cheaper and would do the same job.
  
  Feel free to use everything.
